# Getting Started
Solace is a design system and component library build specifically for solo designers and small teams. 
It's meant to be beautiful, accessible and easy to scale. It's also completly free and open source, forever.

This repository is focused on the Figma Version of the Solace Design System, if you are interested in other versions, follow this link <>

To get started, I recommend downloading the Figma File directly from Figma Community, found here <>
